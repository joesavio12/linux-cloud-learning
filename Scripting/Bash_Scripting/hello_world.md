HELLO WORLD

This file follows the tradition of starting with 'hello world'. But before that some basics on scripting.
Scripting is mainly used for automation. 

Default Shell in LINUX is BASH. Shell is a program used to interact with the OS. 

	* To find which shell you are using, command -  echo $SHELL

	* Use nano file_name.sh to create the script file. ( .sh optional)

	* Now we need to make this executable(Change Permission) - sudo chmod +x file_name.sh

	* To execute ./file_name.sh

At the begining of each script include the shebang(#!) #!/bin/bash
